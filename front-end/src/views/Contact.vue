      <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew!</h1>
      <p>I'm an 80s cartoon, food lovin', Californian; passionate about storytelling and what makes it tick. I will soon graduate from Brigham Young University with a BFA in animation and a minor in Computer Science</p>
      <p>While growing up I quickly discovered that I was passionate about computer games and drawing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Those desires grew to a beautiful marriage between art and technology. I am extremely passionate about growing this marriage and telling stories along with it.</p>
